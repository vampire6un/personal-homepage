## Prompt 1
I want to create a shopping list Chrome extension using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The extension should let users save the URL of the current browser tab.

When a user opens the Chrome extension on a page with an item they like, 
they should be able to select a category and then click a "Save Item" button 
to add the tab's URL to a list displayed below. The shopping list should display 
each item's link next to the category.

The categories to select should be "Books, Clothes, Shoes, Electronics, Pets, Health".

Please suggest a step-by-step guide to help me get started.

## Prompt 2
The user should see a preview of the item name before selecting a category 
and saving it to their list.

Both the preview and shopping list links should display an item's name 
by accessing the current tab's title element. Please truncate the item name to 50 characters.

The saved items should display even after closing or refreshing the browser. 

Update the manifest file as needed, and add detailed code comments 
explaining the JavaScript's functionality.
